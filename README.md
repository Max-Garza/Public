* Sparcity Reduction
	A technical title for a technical project. This file contains code used to test the best way to select words for text mining purposes. Basically, text data is messy, and it's hard to know what words are needed for a proper analysis. This is usually done by removing words that occur less than X% of the time, but I thought there might be a better way - identifying the most important words. So, this file compares the effects of different word selection techniques on text analysis, specifically the categorization of Amazon reviews into specific topics.
